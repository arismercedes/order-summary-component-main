### What I learned

With this challenge I got a better understanding of centering elements.

### Continued development

I've studying html css for 2 weeks nows so theres a lot I need to learn, I feel like I understand the logic off html and css but I want to learn best practices. I'm sure I have many things that are not necessary in my code.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_media_query_breakpoints.asp) -This helped me to understand breakpoints.
- [Resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) - This was so useful centering elements.
